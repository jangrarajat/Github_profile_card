 🚀 Just Built My Responsive GitHub Profile Page Using React + TailwindCSS + GitHub API! 🧑‍💻💻
Hi folks! I recently created a fully responsive GitHub profile page using:
 • ⚛️ React
 • 🎨 Tailwind CSS
 • 🔗 GitHub REST API

It fetches real-time GitHub data like followers, repositories, bio, and shows them in a clean UI.
This helped me improve my API integration, React state management, and frontend layout skills.
